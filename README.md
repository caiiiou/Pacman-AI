I first how to refresh on the different sZZZZearch algorithms since I had only learned what they were and not implemented them before. I then looked at the different data types and the what the functions were in the classes to set the correct format for my code in the search agents. I then combined the logic into the correct Python format. I used AI as a refresher on the different types of search algorithms and mainly for correctly using Python. I had not taken any Python classes in a while so many of the syntax especially of data types not in other languages as well as python specific attributes.
