# Attribution Information: The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley.
# The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero
# (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu).
# Student side autograding was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and
# Pieter Abbeel (pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu).

# Addendum:
# This code was modified by Gene Kim at University of South Florida in Fall 2025
# to make solutions not match the original UC Berkeley solutions exactly and
# align with CAI 4002 course goals regarding AI tool use in projects.
